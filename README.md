# TE-FloatPump

## Potential solutions

### 1. force sensor

The princept behind this solution is to measure two decetral Forcesensors. If one of those sensors is covert under water, the mass of the water in combination with the field of gravitiy will lead to an force delta between the two sensors. This event can be used as a trigger to start the pump as well as sending an SMS. 

### 2. humidity sensor

It´s simply measures the humidity in undistilled water, its possible to define an threshold level as event-trigger.


### 3. ToDo

## Andy 

Webserver 
  -> WebForm (keep in mind no filesystem use variables instead)
  -> emailSend
  
## Tobi

WiFi
  -> AP submit, then as Client
  -> müC adden

## TBD
